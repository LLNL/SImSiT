**v3.1 updates**
-----------------

- Containerized for development
- Fixed bugs related to outdated versions of dependencies (astropy and ssapy). 
- Made pip installable
- Unit tests written
- Documentation written
- Developer workflow documented for open-sourcing
- Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) functionality added to build realistic astronomy scenes in the 2MASS band passes.
- General utility functions added to deal with arbitrary SWIR bands. 


**v3.0 updates**
----------------------------------

- Added the ``sidereal_track`` branch
- Added the ``target_track`` branch
- Generate ephemerides for satellites sampled randomly from public catalogs
- Update satellite size (beta distribution), albedo (uniform distribution), and brightness (Lambertian sphere) distributions
- Update image seeing, transparency, sky brightness, and pointing offsets to change smoothly as a function of time

**v2.3 updates**
----------------

- Target branch now uses Gaia catalog
- Re-simulated both the Target and Sidereal branches

**v2.2 updates**
----------------

- Added variable integration times to sidereal branch
- Added production of ``sky_flat.fits`` on the sidereal branch
- Fixed ra/dec scoring on sidereal branch
- Combined checking and scoring scripts in every branch
- Added variable sky brightness to sidereal branch
- Added flux calibration factor to sidereal branch image headers
- Re-simulated sidereal branch with all changes, increasing from 505 images to 1,010
- Added 10 truth objects to each applicable file (previously 5), and updated file names to reflect

**v2.1 updates**
----------------

- Updated scoring scripts
- Replaced 4 scores in the ``calibrate/sidereal``, ``detect/sidereal``, and ``detect/target`` branches with "completeness" and "false positive rate"
- Column labels added to all ``score_history.txt`` files
- Added 5 more simulated images to calibrate branch
- Added a section to each branch's README file that explains what each score is

**v2.0 updates**
----------------

- Added a "Calibrate - Sidereal Tracking" branch
- Added optional "predicted downrange location" values to IOD branch submission files, giving the option to supply ra and dec values of the satellite at four times downrange (5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes)
- Added the option to supply covariances on the IOD branch, for both predicted downrange location, as well as predicted state vector
