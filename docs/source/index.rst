Welcome to SatIST's documentation!
==================================

The Satellite Image Simulation Toolkit (SatIST) is a python software package designed 
to generate diverse and realistic satellite imaging scenarios. It serves as a toolkit 
for simulating data that supports the development and testing of algorithms used in 
satellite detection, calibration, and characterization. SatIST provides a suite of 
simulation tools that allow users to replicate various satellite observation conditions, 
including sidereal and target tracking. By enabling the creation of scenarios that mimic 
real-world satellite operations, SatIST facilitates advancements in satellite image data
processing and the study of satellite behavior under different observational parameters.
