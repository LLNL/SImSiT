Welcome to SImSiT's documentation!
==================================

The Satellite Image Simulation Toolkit (SImSiT) is a python software package designed 
to generate diverse and realistic satellite imaging scenarios. It serves as a toolkit 
for simulating data that supports the development and testing of algorithms used in 
satellite detection, calibration, and characterization. SImSiT provides a suite of 
simulation tools that allow users to replicate various satellite observation conditions, 
including sidereal and target tracking. By enabling the creation of scenarios that mimic 
real-world satellite operations, SImSiT facilitates advancements in satellite image data
processing and the study of satellite behavior under different observational parameters.

   Example of simulated image output from SImSiT. Left: An example image taken with sidereal (star) tracking, 
   where the fast-moving satellite appears as a streak across the image. Right: An example image taken with 
   satellite tracking, where the stars appear as streaks, and the satellite appears as a point source.

.. note:: Finding your way around

   A good place to get started is with the installation guide, getting started page and
   the the tutorial examples.
